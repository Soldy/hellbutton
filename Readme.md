# About

This is a theoretical experiment project that can help me to force myself to learn more about svg. I work with svg for the last 15 years. But always have something that I never tried. I used class to change color, but I never tried to build svg lines with code. Like most of us, I used canvas for complex things like this. 

# Where is used? 

Julia has an experimental sci-fi-like interface that will have these buttons.
